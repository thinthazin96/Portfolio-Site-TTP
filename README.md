# Portfolio-Site-TTP

Hello everyone! This is a personal portfolio site I have created using Django framwork that I learned during the NYC Technical Talent Pipline Bootcamp at John Jay Colllege. 
In this portfolio, I am currently showcasing five frontend projects that I really like and going to add more in future.

Here is the demo of five frontend projects:
 <br /> 1. https://thinthazin96.github.io/Light-Dark-Mode/
 <br /> 2. https://thinthazin96.github.io/Form-Animation/
 <br /> 3. https://thinthazin96.github.io/Movie-Booking/
 <br /> 4. https://thinthazin96.github.io/Calculator/
 <br /> 5. https://thinthazin96.github.io/Meal-Finder/
