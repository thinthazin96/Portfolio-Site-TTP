# Portfolio-Site-TTP

Hello everyone! This is a personal portfolio site I have created using Django framwork that I learned during the NYC Technical Talent Pipline Bootcamp at John Jay Colllege. 

 <br /> In this portfolio, I am currently showcasing five frontend projects that I really like and going to add more in future.

Here is the demo of five frontend projects:
